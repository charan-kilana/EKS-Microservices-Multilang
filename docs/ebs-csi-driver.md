## ðŸ“¦ Why Add the EBS CSI Plugin to the EKS Cluster?

The **Amazon EBS CSI (Container Storage Interface) plugin** is required in EKS to enable Kubernetes to manage **Amazon EBS volumes** as persistent storage for stateful workloads.

### âœ… Key Reasons:

- **Persistent Storage for Pods**: Allows your pods (like Redis, MySQL, etc.) to request and attach EBS volumes dynamically using PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
- **Stateful Workloads Support**: Essential for StatefulSets that need stable, durable storage even if pods restart or move.
- **Separation of Concerns**: CSI drivers decouple storage logic from core Kubernetes, enabling better portability and maintainability.
- **AWS Best Practice**: Amazon recommends using the EBS CSI driver instead of the in-tree volume plugin (which is deprecated).

### ðŸ§  Real Use Case in This Project:

We're deploying **Redis** as a StatefulSet, which requires a **PersistentVolume** to store cart/session data.  
To allow Redis pods to attach EBS volumes, the **EBS CSI plugin must be installed** and configured on the EKS cluster.
